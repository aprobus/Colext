{"body":"# Colext\r\n\r\n## What it is\r\n\r\nColext, or Collective Expenses Tracker, is made to keep track of\r\nexpenses that are split evenly between a group of people. An example\r\nof this would be roommates splitting all the bills (water, gas,\r\nelectricity, cable, etc) evenly. When deciding if you want to use\r\nColext, keep these things in mind:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Expenses are split evenly across the whole group, there is no\r\npartial expense splitting\r\n2. You can only belong to one group\r\n\r\nSo, if you are looking to keep track of individual expenses, Colext\r\nis not for you. However, if you find yourself keeping track of expenses\r\nwith the same group of people over and over, Colext can help.\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nColext keeps track of how much everyone has spent on shared expenses\r\ncompared to the rest of the members of the group, and uses that to\r\ndetermine who owes/is owed money. To do so, Colect uses the simple\r\nformula: [sum of expenses] / [number of people]. If a user has paid\r\nmore than that amount, they are owed money. If they have paid less,\r\nthey owe money. It's that simple.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n![Main screen shot](/images/colext_main.jpg)\r\n\r\nColext was designed as a one page web application, there there is no jumping around. It features a list of expenses, an expenses summary, and a visual of the summary. To view past expenses, click the button in the top middle of the page to bring up the time span selector.\r\n\r\n![History selector shot](/images/colext_history.jpg)\r\n\r\nSelect the period which you want to see, and the history page will be brought up. (The period which you are currently viewing is in orange)\r\n\r\n![History shot](/images/colext_history_view.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple, expenses can only be added to the current time span. Note, to view the expense's comment, simply hover over it to get the full view.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nColext relies on several projects, including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n### Node (www.nodejs.org)\r\n\r\nAll of the backend code was written in node. I chose it because that's what I'm\r\nusing at work, and you can never get enough practice.\r\n\r\n### Emberjs (www.emberjs.com)\r\n\r\nUsed for all of the client side MVC. It is amazing for keeping data/views\r\nsynced up.\r\n\r\n### Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)\r\n\r\nMakes the UI look a lot nicer than it would have if I had to do all the UI work.\r\n\r\n### Glyphicons (http://glyphicons.com/)\r\n\r\nAll of the icons are from Glyphicons, through Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Aaron Probus\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
