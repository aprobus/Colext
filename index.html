<h2>What it is</h2>

<p>Colext, or Collective Expenses Tracker, is made to keep track of
expenses that are split evenly between a group of people. An example
of this would be roommates splitting all the bills (water, gas,
electricity, cable, etc) evenly. When deciding if you want to use
Colext, keep these things in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Expenses are split evenly across the whole group, there is no
partial expense splitting</li>
<li>You can only belong to one group</li>
</ol><p>So, if you are looking to keep track of individual expenses, Colext
is not for you. However, if you find yourself keeping track of expenses
with the same group of people over and over, Colext can help.</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

<p>Colext keeps track of how much everyone has spent on shared expenses
compared to the rest of the members of the group, and uses that to
determine who owes/is owed money. To do so, Colect uses the simple
formula: [sum of expenses] / [number of people]. If a user has paid
more than that amount, they are owed money. If they have paid less,
they owe money. It's that simple.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p><img src="images/colext_main.jpg" alt="Main screen shot"></p>

<p>Colext was designed as a one page web application, there there is no jumping around. It features a list of expenses, an expenses summary, and a visual of the summary. To view past expenses, click the button in the top middle of the page to bring up the time span selector.</p>

<p>Select the period which you want to see, and the history page will be brought up. (The period which you are currently viewing is in orange)</p>

<p>To keep things simple, expenses can only be added to the current time span. Note, to view the expense's comment, simply hover over it to get the full view.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Colext relies on several projects, including, but not limited to:</p>

<h3>Node (<a href="http://www.nodejs.org">www.nodejs.org</a>)</h3>

<p>All of the backend code was written in node. I chose it because that's what I'm
using at work, and you can never get enough practice.</p>

<h3>Emberjs (<a href="http://www.emberjs.com">www.emberjs.com</a>)</h3>

<p>Used for all of the client side MVC. It is amazing for keeping data/views
synced up.</p>

<h3>Bootstrap (<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a>)</h3>

<p>Makes the UI look a lot nicer than it would have if I had to do all the UI work.</p>

<h3>Glyphicons (<a href="http://glyphicons.com/">http://glyphicons.com/</a>)</h3>

<p>All of the icons are from Glyphicons, through Bootstrap.</p>
